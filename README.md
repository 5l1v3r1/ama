# ASK ME ANYTHING (AMA)

Feel free to ask me **ANYTHING**.

I really mean anything. It does not have to be developer related. It can be life,
personal, work, hobby, code, whatever.

## Guidelines

- :mag: Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- :page_facing_up: Use a succinct title and description.
- :bug: Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- :signal_strength: Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- :blush: Be nice, civil and polite.
- :heart_eyes: If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback will probably come faster.
